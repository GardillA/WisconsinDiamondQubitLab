"""
g(2) routine. For each event on one channel, calculates the deltas relative to
the events on the opposite channel and plots a histogram of the deltas. Here
the events are photon detections from the same source, but split over two
APDs. The splitting is necessary to compensate for the APD dead time, which
is typically significantly longer than the lifetime of the excited state we
are interested in.
