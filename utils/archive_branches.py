"""This script will archive branches. A branch should be archived if you're
done working with it so that it doesn't clutter the repo. Generally we want
a record of our work so we don't want to delete branches outright.

Archiving is done by tagging them as archive/<branchname> and removing them
both locally and remotely. Before each operation, the user is asked for
confirmation.
