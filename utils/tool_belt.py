# %% Safe stop (TM mccambria)


"""
Safe stop allows you to listen for a stop command while other things are
happening. This allows you to, say, stop a loop-based routine halfway
through. To use safe stop, call init_safe_stop() and then poll for the
stop command with safe_stop(). It's up to you to actually stop the
routine once you get the signal. Note that there's no way to programmatically
halt safe stop once it's running; the user must press enter.

Safe stop works by setting up a second thread alongside the main
thread. This thread listens for input, and sets a threading event after
the input. A threading event is just a flag used for communication between
threads. safe_stop() simply returns whether the flag is set.
