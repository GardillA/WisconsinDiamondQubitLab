This codebase is based off of the codebase originally used in Shimon Kolkowitz's lab, circa 2020. It was originally created by Matt Cambria and Aedan Gardill, however is its own repo. 
The code is based in Python and uses LabRad to control individual servers for each piece of hardware to perform quantum measurements on nitrogen vacancy centers.
Some information about the use of LabRad can be found here.
